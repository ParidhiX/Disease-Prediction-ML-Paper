## üîπ Abstract
This research focuses on predicting diseases based on symptoms using **machine learning algorithms**.  
We implemented and compared multiple supervised classifiers, including **Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest**.  
The study highlights the accuracy of different models, with **Random Forest achieving the highest accuracy of 100%**.  

The work also emphasizes dataset preprocessing, feature encoding, and the importance of proper train-test splits (70:30, 80:20) to minimize overfitting and improve generalization.
